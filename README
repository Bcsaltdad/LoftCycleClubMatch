For your fitness class recommendation logic, I'd recommend using a serverless function through Vercel or Netlify. Here's why:
Low maintenance: No servers to manage or update
Cost-effective: Free tier handles thousands of recommendations per month
Simple deployment: Push code to GitHub and it automatically deploys
Easy integration: Works seamlessly with your Squarespace site
Scalability: Automatically handles traffic spikes during promotions
This approach gives you the best balance of simplicity and flexibility. Your recommendation logic would be hosted separately from Squarespace, but easily accessible via API.
Here's a simplified implementation plan:
Create a GitHub repository for your function
Write your recommendation algorithm in JavaScript/Node.js
Connect the repository to Vercel/Netlify
Deploy automatically when you push changes
Use the provided endpoint URL in your Squarespace site's JavaScript
This keeps your business logic separate from presentation, allowing you to modify your algorithm without touching your website code. It also gives you room to expand features later (like personalized emails or tracking which recommendations users actually book).
Would you like me to outline the specific steps to set this up with Vercel or Netlify, or would you prefer a different approach?
